* [Stochastic Star Formation & Feedback: Mapping Low-Mass Galaxies to Dark Matter Haloes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.7097v1) 
This potentially star-forming gas is unlikely to be replenished in lower mass haloes because of, e.g. cosmological 
reionization, and so we expect galaxy formation to be stymied in a manner that depends on host halo assembly history and 
the efficiency and timing of star formation in proto-galaxies, which we illustrate using a Monte Carlo model. 
Based on these simple physical arguments, we assert that stochasticity of star formation and feedback is an essential but 
overlooked ingredient in modelling galaxy formation on the smallest scales.
